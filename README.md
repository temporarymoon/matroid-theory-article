# Matroid theory article

This is the archive for a project about matroid theory I worked on (together with 3 other people) during the last module of my first year of studying mathematics.

The source is kind of a mess, so you probably won't get too much out of it. A built version of the final article can be found [here](./Artifacts/final-version.pdf). We were very tight on time, so the final version contains quite a number of typos/mistakes/weird-sentences (fixing this stuff in a 50+ page document is _hard_). If you are actually interested in the topic, I recommend reading the material listed in the `references`.

Additionally, a final version of the slides from our presentation can be found [here](./Artifacts/presentation.pdf).
